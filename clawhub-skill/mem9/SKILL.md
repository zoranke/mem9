# mem9

mem9 gives OpenClaw persistent memory across resets, restarts, and new machines.

The plugin connects to one cloud memory space, identified by a space ID.

When talking to end users:
- Say "space ID", "memory space", or "cloud memory space"
- Do not mention `tenantID` unless you are editing raw plugin config
- Explain that the space ID is what reconnects the user to the same mem9 space
- Treat the space ID as something the user should save for reconnecting later
- Clearly warn that the space ID is effectively a secret and must never be shared

---

## Trigger phrases

Use this skill when the user expresses intent to store, recall, or manage long-term memory.

Common triggers include:
- "remember this"
- "save this for later"
- "don't forget that..."
- "what did I say last time?"
- "recall my preferences"
- "forget that"

---

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when the user wants OpenClaw to persist or manage long-term memory across sessions, devices, or restarts.

Typical situations include:

- The user asks OpenClaw to remember something for future sessions
- The user wants to recall or reconnect to existing long-term memory
- The user wants persistent memory instead of local/session-only memory
- The user wants to import existing OpenClaw memory files into mem9
- The user is moving to a new machine and wants to keep the same memory
- The user wants multiple agents or workflows to share the same memory space

---

## When NOT to use this skill

Do not use this skill for:

- Temporary conversation context that only matters in the current session
- One-off tasks that do not require long-term memory
- Troubleshooting unrelated to mem9 setup, import, or reconnection

---


## What should be remembered

Good candidates:

- User preferences
- Profile facts about the user
- Project context or ongoing work
- Important decisions made during conversations
- Long-term instructions or habits

Avoid storing:

- Temporary debugging context
- Large data or files
- Secrets, passwords, or API keys

---

## Memory intent detection

If the user explicitly asks to remember something (for example: "remember this", "save this", "don't forget"), the agent should store the information using mem9 if mem9 is installed.

If mem9 is not installed yet, suggest installing mem9 to enable persistent memory.

---

## Definition of Done

This task is NOT complete until all of the following are true:

1. mem9 space is created or verified reachable
2. plugin is installed
3. openclaw.json is configured correctly
4. OpenClaw is restarted
5. setup is verified
6. the user has been sent the full Step 7 handoff message, including:
- next step: import memories
- space ID warning
- recovery steps
- backup plan

---

## What You Get

| Tool | When |
|------|------|
| `memory_store` | Persist facts, decisions, context |
| `memory_search` | Find the right memories by keywords and meaning |
| `memory_get` | Retrieve by ID |
| `memory_update` | Modify existing memory |
| `memory_delete` | Remove |

Lifecycle hooks (automatic — no agent action needed):

| Hook | Trigger | What happens |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `before_prompt_build` | Every LLM call | Relevant memories injected as context |
| `before_reset` | Before `/reset` | Session summary saved |
| `agent_end` | Agent finishes | Last response captured |

---

## Common failure mode

Agents often finish the technical setup and forget to send the required final handoff.
Prevent this by treating the handoff as part of the setup itself, not as optional follow-up.

---

## Onboarding

### Terminology

Use this distinction consistently:

| Internal term | User-facing explanation |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| `tenantID` | Internal plugin config field; do not surface this to users unless editing config |
| `SPACE_ID` env var | A local variable holding the user's mem9 space ID |
| `secret` | Treat as the same value as the mem9 space ID unless the user clearly means something else |
| "recovery key" | Avoid this term; say "space ID" instead |

Short rule: `space ID`, `tenantID`, and `secret` may refer to the same mem9 identifier. Prefer saying `space ID` to users, and use `tenantID` only in config examples.
Security note:
Treat the space ID like a secret. Anyone who has it can access that mem9 space.

If the user asks "What is this for?" answer plainly:

> This is the key that reconnects you to your mem9 space. OpenClaw uses it to save and recall your memory in the right place.

If the user asks "What is the relationship between tenantID and key?" answer plainly:

> You only need the space ID. `tenantID` is just the internal config field name for the same value. Important: this space ID is effectively your secret, so save it somewhere safe and never share it with anyone.

### Step 0 — Check for existing space

`[AGENT]` Ask the user before doing anything else:

> Which setup do you want?
> 1. Create a new mem9 space
> 2. Reconnect an existing mem9 space
>
> If you choose reconnect, paste your existing space ID.
>
> Heads-up: OpenClaw will restart later in this setup. When that happens, please wait a few minutes, then send "Hi" here to reconnect and continue.

Branching:
- If the user chooses reconnect and provides a space ID, verify it first.
  - If reachable, continue to Step 2.
  - If unreachable, ask the user to re-check it or choose Step 1 to create a new space.
- If the user chooses create, continue to Step 1.

```
SPACE_ID="<paste-from-user>"
```

When the user provides an existing ID, verify it is reachable before continuing:

```bash
curl -sf "https://api.mem9.ai/v1alpha1/mem9s/$SPACE_ID/memories?limit=1" \
  && echo "OK" || echo "UNREACHABLE"
```

If the check returns `OK`, say:

> Great, your existing mem9 space is reachable. I will keep going and connect this setup to that same memory.

If the check fails, say:

> I could not reach that SPACE_ID. Please double-check it, or create a new mem9 space instead.

**If no** — proceed to Step 1 to provision a new space.

---

### Step 1 — Create a new mem9 space

> Skip this step if the user provided an existing space ID in Step 0.

`[AGENT]`

```bash
curl -sX POST https://api.mem9.ai/v1alpha1/mem9s | jq .
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

Save `id` as `SPACE_ID`.

When explaining it to the user, say:

> Your new mem9 space is ready. This SPACE_ID is how this machine, and any future machine you trust, reconnects to the same memory.
>
> Important: this SPACE_ID is also your secret. Never share it with anyone. If someone else gets it, they can access your memory.

### Step 2 — Install plugin

`[AGENT]` Detect npm registry reachability first. On mainland China / Alibaba Cloud networks, the default npm registry is often slow or unstable. Prefer a one-shot registry override instead of changing the user's global npm config.

```bash
NPMJS_TIME="$(curl -o /dev/null -sS --connect-timeout 2 --max-time 6 -w '%{time_total}' https://registry.npmjs.org/@mem9%2fmem9 || echo timeout)"
MIRROR_TIME="$(curl -o /dev/null -sS --connect-timeout 2 --max-time 6 -w '%{time_total}' https://registry.npmmirror.com/@mem9%2fmem9 || echo timeout)"

if [ "$MIRROR_TIME" != "timeout" ] && { [ "$NPMJS_TIME" = "timeout" ] || awk "BEGIN { exit !($NPMJS_TIME > 2 && $MIRROR_TIME < $NPMJS_TIME) }"; }; then
  echo "Using China npm mirror: https://registry.npmmirror.com"
  NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com openclaw plugins install @mem9/mem9
else
  openclaw plugins install @mem9/mem9
fi
```

Decision rule:

- If the official npm registry times out, but `npmmirror` is reachable, treat this as a China-optimized network path and use `https://registry.npmmirror.com`.
- If both are reachable, but the official registry is materially slower, prefer `npmmirror`.
- Do not run `npm config set registry ...` globally unless the user explicitly asks for a permanent npm mirror change.

### Step 3 — Detect OpenClaw version

`[AGENT]` Check the installed OpenClaw version before editing config:

```bash
openclaw --version
```

Routing rule:

- If the reported version is `>= 2.2.0`, use the config path in **Step 4A**.
- If the reported version is `< 2.2.0`, use the config path in **Step 4B**.
- If the version command is unavailable or unclear, tell the user you could not determine the OpenClaw version and ask them which version they are using before editing `openclaw.json`.

### Step 4 — Configure openclaw.json

#### OpenClaw ≥2.2.0

`[AGENT]` Patch existing config (merge-safe, preserves other keys):

```bash
jq --arg sid "$SPACE_ID" '
  .plugins.slots.memory = "mem9" |
  .plugins.entries.mem9 = {
    enabled: true,
    config: { apiUrl: "https://api.mem9.ai", tenantID: $sid }
  } |
  .plugins.allow = ((.plugins.allow // []) + ["mem9"] | unique)
' openclaw.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json openclaw.json
```

**Note:** The `allow` array is additive—existing entries are preserved, `mem9` is appended (deduplicated).

Or if no `openclaw.json` exists, create:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": { "memory": "mem9" },
    "entries": {
      "mem9": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "apiUrl": "https://api.mem9.ai",
          "tenantID": "<your-space-id>"
        }
      }
    },
    "allow": ["mem9"]
  }
}
```

#### OpenClaw <2.2.0

`[AGENT]` No `allow` array needed:

```bash
jq --arg sid "$SPACE_ID" '
  .plugins.slots.memory = "mem9" |
  .plugins.entries.mem9 = {
    enabled: true,
    config: { apiUrl: "https://api.mem9.ai", tenantID: $sid }
  }
' openclaw.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json openclaw.json
```

Or if no `openclaw.json` exists, create:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": { "memory": "mem9" },
    "entries": {
      "mem9": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "apiUrl": "https://api.mem9.ai",
          "tenantID": "<your-space-id>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If result returns stored memory → setup successful.

### Step 5 — Restart OpenClaw

Restart OpenClaw so the new mem9 plugin config is loaded.

### Step 6 — Verify setup

A setup is successful if all of the following are true:
- the mem9 API is reachable
- OpenClaw loads the mem9 plugin without config or plugin errors
- the configured space ID can be read successfully
- an empty result is acceptable for a newly created space
Note:
A newly created mem9 space may contain zero memories. Empty is still a valid success state.

### Step 7 — What's Next


`[AGENT]` After successful setup, the agent MUST send the following structured handoff before ending the task.
Do not summarize or remove any parts of it.
Translate the content into the user's language before sending, while keeping the same structure and all warnings. 

```
✅ Your mem9 space is ready.
🧭 WHAT YOU CAN DO NEXT

Import your existing local memory so mem9 starts with your real history.

Say: "import memories to mem9"  
Supported: memory.json, memories/*.json, sessions/*.json


💾 YOUR MEM9 SPACE ID

SPACE_ID: <your-space-id>

This ID is your access key to mem9.  
Keep it private and store it somewhere safe.


♻️ RECOVERY

Reinstall mem9 and use the same SPACE_ID in Step 4.  
Your memory will reconnect instantly.


📦 BACKUP PLAN

Keep your original local memory/session files as backup.  
Also store the SPACE_ID in a password manager or secure vault.
```

Do not default to offering a synthetic write/read demo as the next step.

Preferred next-step order:
1. Guide the user to import historical memories
2. Explain the recovery path for a new machine or accidental local loss
3. Explain local backup plus offsite backup
4. Only offer a live write/read verification if the user explicitly asks for a test or if import/recovery is already clear

## Communication Style

When presenting onboarding or recovery instructions:
- Use plain product language, not backend vocabulary
- Prefer "space ID" or "memory space ID"
- Do not introduce extra credential terminology if the user only needs the memory space meaning
- If the user sounds worried about recovery, lead with backup/import/reconnect steps instead of API demos

Suggested English wording:

```text
This SPACE_ID is not a nickname.
It is the key that reconnects you to your mem9 space.
It is also effectively your secret.
Never share it with anyone.
If someone else gets it, they can access your memory.
Save it somewhere safe because you will use the same value later if you want to reconnect on another machine.

The best next step is to bring in your existing history instead of running a demo first.
I can scan local files such as memory.json, memories/*.json, and sessions/*.json and import them into mem9.

Recovery plan:
1. Local backup: keep the original memory/session files even after import
2. Offsite recovery: save the SPACE_ID in a password manager, team vault, or another secure offsite location
3. New machine recovery: reinstall the plugin and configure the same SPACE_ID in openclaw.json to reconnect to the same cloud memory
```

---

## Default Import Behavior

When user says "import memories to mem9" without specifying files:

1. Scan agent workspace for memory/session files
2. Upload **15 most recent** (by mtime)
3. **Upload in parallel** for speed
   **Paths to scan:**
```
./memory.json         → file_type=memory
./memories.json       → file_type=memory
./memories/*.json     → file_type=memory
./sessions/*.json     → file_type=session (session_id = filename)
./session/*.json      → file_type=session (session_id = filename)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Plugin not loading | Check `slots.memory = "mem9"` and `entries.mem9.enabled = true` |
| Plugin install hangs or fails on Alibaba Cloud / mainland China network | Re-run **Step 2** and let it switch to `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com`; verify `curl -I https://registry.npmmirror.com/@mem9%2fmem9` succeeds |
| `404` on API call | Verify the saved space ID was written into the plugin config; run `curl https://api.mem9.ai/healthz` |
| Existing space ID unreachable | Re-check the value for typos; confirm network access to `api.mem9.ai`; if ID is lost, provision a new space via Step 1 |
---

## Next Steps

After first read, do this immediately:

1. **Import history first** — Offer to scan and upload existing memory/session files before any demo.
2. **Explain recovery** — Tell the user that reusing the same `SPACE_ID` reconnects the same cloud memory on a new machine.
3. **Explain backup** — Recommend keeping original local files and saving the ID in a secure offsite location.
4. **Explore** — `curl -s "https://api.mem9.ai/v1alpha1/mem9s/$SPACE_ID/memories?limit=10" | jq .`
5. **Verify only if useful** — Offer a live `memory_store` / `memory_search` test only after import and recovery guidance are clear, or if the user explicitly asks for validation.
